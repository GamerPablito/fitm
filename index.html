                                This mod was created on January 6th, 2023 by the artist, L-C 380 (Director,
                            Writer, General Artist). After gathering a large group of people to develop this
                            mod, FUNKYVERSAL STUDIO was created, a studio created solely to define the public
                            image of the mod team.

                            difficultes. More episodes will be developed in the future, trying to provide
                            THE BEST EXPERIENCE possible, with the upcoming 4th episode being based on
                            the indie game, Hollow Knight.
